I've recently had this epiphany that I am responsible for how I feel, and, quite frankly, I don't want to feel crappy any more.

To an outsider this may seem obvious, like of course, but I dunno. For a while, I've felt that my life has been in a spiral, with me in the middle of it all, losing a sense of control of all of my events and responsibilities. This hasn't reflected in me causing direct failure, but it had deteriorated my health both physically and mentally. I can feel it bubbling up, but having realized this ephiphany, I think I have a way to stop the bubble from popping. 

Through this, I will employ a couple steps.
