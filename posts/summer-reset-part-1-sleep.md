## The Problem
As a kid, I thought getting less sleep and going to bed at crazy hours was just a natural progression of becoming a teen/adult, almost like a rite of passage. Having then grown up and am now a fully-fledged teen... uh... _what was I thinking_? I have work to do and yet just push it off with my dumb kid mindset that this is just the status-quo, resulting in me simply being so exhausted and brainless. I then take naps when I go home only exacerbating the issue.

## My Solution
Become a kid again. 

No but really. As a kid I used to have a bedtime routine where I would go to sleep at a certain time with a specific routine instead of just going to sleep in whatever position I was in when I faceplanted into bed in exhaustion. 

Looking into it there are a couple general steps I need to encorporate into my sleep schedule.
* Go to sleep and wake up at the same time. 
* Get sunlight in right when you wake up and right before the sunsets.
* No caffeine 10-12 hours before you go to sleep (essentially no caffeine after noon)
* No bright lights near when you are going to sleep
  * For this, I plan in incorporating some reading time into my schedule.

My plan for waking up, [based off of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roK4g1e28mM)
1. Wake up 13 minutes before Fajr. Pray Isha' and Fajr. Go back to bed.
   * This wasn't in the video, but equally important in my morning routine!
2. Wake up at 6:15a.m.
   * Write down time woken up
   * Go splash some water on face, brush teeth, apply sunscreen face cream
3. Get some sunlight: go on a 15 minute bike circuit. 
   * Not meant to be long, just something to do to get some sunlight in before my day starts.
   * I will be incorporating a more rigourous training regimine as well.
4. Drink salt (0.5tsp), lemon juice, and water mixture
5. Do a 90 minute productivity session __PHONE NOT IN ROOM__
   * Andrew Huberman's audience is primarily working people.
   * This will either be working on a coding project or something else in line with my [dopamine detox](#step-2-dopamine-detox)
6. Exersize (~8:15a.m to 10a.m.)
7. "Deliberate Cold Exposure"
   * I heard this is also good for the hair as well, so doubly good!
8. No caffeine until 8 (good before exercise). Black tea and Green Tea ideally.
9. No food until 11am.
10. Go on with day

My plan for going to sleep, [based off of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3eS4jr2pIo)
1. Go for an evening walk with my family ~8:00pm. No more electronics after this.
2. Start my evening routine by taking a shower.
3. Read until I go to sleep ~10:00pm
