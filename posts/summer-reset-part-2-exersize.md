## The Problem
I currently have no work out regiment but want to start encorporating one. On top of living and feeling fit, there are numerous health benefits I have not been reaping that I think need to have a place in my life!

## My Solution
Andrew Huberman at it with another great workout plan. This will fit into the workout hour I have in my previous [Sleep](/posts/summer-reset-part-1-sleep) step.

Here is what I want my daily program to turn into this summer.

1. Sunday: Long Endurance Workout
   * 90 minute bike ride. I hope I can get to around ~20 miles. Consistently.
2. Monday: Leg Day* @ GYM
   * 10-minute warmup + 50/60 minute training
   * Alternate A/B monthly
   * Quads: Leg Extension & Hack Squats
   * Hamstrings: Leg curls & Glute-ham-raises
   * Calves: Standing raises & seated raises
3. Tuesday: Hot/Cold Day
   * I don't think I can do this one, so it will be a rest day.
4. Wednesday: Torso & Neck Day* @ GYM
   * 10-minute warmup + 50/60 minute training
   * Alternate A/B monthly
   * Chest: incline press & cable crossover
   * Back: chin-up & seated row or dumbbell row
   * shoulders: shoulder press & lateral raises
   * neck: [this video](https://youtu.be/wjiZaCJ6tCA)
5. Thursday: Cardio Training
   * 35 minutes at 75-80% max effort
   * biking!
6. Friday: HIIT @ GYM
   * 20-60 seconds all out print + 10 seconds rest * 8-12 times
   * max heart rate 220-age
   * bike 
7. Saturday: Arms, Neck & Calves* @ GYM
   * 10-minute warmup + 50-60 minutes training
   * Alternate Schedule A&B
   * Biceps: incline curl & dumbell curls
   * Triceps: overhead extensions & triceps dips
   * Calves: standing calf raise & tibialis raises
   * Neck: [this video](https://youtu.be/wjiZaCJ6tCA)

> Schedule A: ~4-8 repetitions (heavier weights) and 3-4 sets per exercise with 2-4 minutes rest between sets

> Schedule B: ~8-15 repetitions (moderate-lighter weights) and 2-3 sets per exercise with ~90 seconds rest betweensets

### Better with Friends?
I hope to (coerce) convince some of my friends to at least come with me on the days I go to the gym.

Kinda excited for this.
